"""
This example shows fraction of votes that was given to first 3
candidates from given list. The smaller this percent is, the more
known are candidates from further positions.

If votes distribution would be equal throughout the lists - that
would indicated some conscious decisions while voting. Voting on
first candidate can indicate that the list consists of weak candidates
and voters are more interested in giving vote on the list itself having
trust for the committee creators.

Color code:
- beige: MANY fraction of votes for first 3 candidates from list
- blue: LITTLE fraction of votes for first 3 candidates from list

Smoothness of values across constituencies mayb indicate that the
candidates are not well-known. Major differences between regions
indicate that different candidates get their support in different
regions, which means that they are well known and strongly connected
to their local communities.

Please take into consideration that list of candidates are the same
throughout single constituency. Some sharp edges in values maybe
effect of a candidate being well known in particular are - for example
she/he is an active politician and is known for some formal operation
or decisions made in relation to given ares, but this is only a guess
and would need further investigation.
